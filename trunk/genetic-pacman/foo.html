<h3 align="center">CSSE 413: Machine Learning Programming Assignment</h3>

<h4>Overview</h4>

The purpose of this assignment is to explore a machine learning
technique of your choice in more detail. You will use a modified
version of the Pacman Tournament player to implement and experiment
with a particular technique. The experiments you conduct are as important
as the qualiy of your implementation.


<h4>Specifics</h4>

<ul>

<li>Based on the feedback, I received, I assigned the following <a
href="http://www.rose-hulman.edu/class/csse/csse413/assignments/machineLearning/teams.html">teams
and topics</a>

<li>For this project, you need to perform some research. You need to

<ul>

<li>Study the technique beyond what we introduce in class.

<li>Either develop or possibly download and extend existing Python
code that implements those techniques and adapt them to your
needs.

<li>Develop a good way of representing the domain
to make learning possible.

<li>Experiment with several layouts (see the layouts folder) and types
of game play (see below.)

</ul>

<li>A large portion of your grade will depend on the experiments you
conduct as well as a careful analysis of those experiments. Your grade
for this programming assignment will not depend on whether your chosen
approach works well or not, although you need to do a good job
implementing it.

<li>We are going to make a few modifications to the <a href="ML.html">code</a>.
In particular, we will have:

<ul>
<li>Complete vision of food, pacmen and ghosts
<li>Eating pacmen gets points (to be specific, 10 points)
</ul>

<li>You might be interested in the following options:

<ul>

<li>python capture.py --record will record a game. Play it back with
--replay=<REPLAYFILE>

<li>python capture.py -x NUMTRAINING will specify number of training games
to play

<li>python capture.py --time=TIME will specify the length of a game in
number of moves

<li>python capture.py -f will fix the random seed

<li>Each of these options are available from python capture.py -h
</ul>


</ul>


<h4>Administrative Details</h4>

<ul>

<li>In addition to developing software and conducting experiments, you
are asked to write up a report containing the results of your
experiments and a careful analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of your
approach. This report should contain some tables or figures
summarizing the results of your experiments.

<li>The report and software is tentatively due on Monday, October 22nd
at midnight.

<li>You will give a brief (5 minute) presentation of your results and
evaluation during class on the day following the due date.

</ul>
